His directives have been discovered on supposedly blank audio tape and video cassetes, and one young SubGenius swears a speaking Dobbshead appeared to him on the video game, GORF.  
%
Some are convinced his "thermal sense" is so acute that he can look at a bed and see the 'heat outline' of someone who slept there days earlier.  
%
Another thing: although most American food IS dangerous to human life, and godawful radiations pour from every appliance and power-line, REMEMBER: SubGeniuses are mutants anyway.  
%
So how do you get a healthy, slackful outlook in the face of rampant ecohell? YOU PLUNGE INTO ECOHELL HEAD FIRST.

"Bob" asks you to give up  only your wallet, and a relatively insignificant  portion of your mind. The Conspiracy wants you  to GIVE UP, PERIOD.  
%
For we, too, have an "Eye,"  and that Eye is "Bob." He is the telephone  by which Man can harass the very gods.  
%
He can 'apport' objects -that is, expel impossible things  spontaneously from his mouth or other openings. He once terrified a diplomat's wife by apporting a great pile of Pipes out onto her bed.  
%
Some say he emits 'chirps'  in the dark to help find his way around  by an echolocation sense similar to a bat's.  
%

Our minds are too WELL-WORN, too SMUDGED and STAINED to be completely washed by their insidious "mind-cleaning" techniques.  
%
"Bob" can handle the aliens but we must police ourselves.  
%
Slack is like freedom, but unlike freedom it brings no responsibility.
